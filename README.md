![React Budget App](public/React%20budget%20app.png)

The React Budget App is a simple budget management application built using React. This application helps users plan, calculate, and manage their budgets with ease. The app comes equipped with several key features, including the ability to change budgets, calculate remaining budget, manage item price allocations, add/reduce item prices, modify price allocations, and change currencies.

## Features

1. Change Budget

   Users can modify the initial budget that has been set. This allows users to adjust the budget according to their needs and changing circumstances.

2. Calculate Remaining Budget

   The app will calculate and display the remaining budget available after users make spending allocations.

3. Calculate Item Price Allocations

   Users can input the prices of items they intend to purchase, and the app will automatically calculate the total allocated amount.

4. Add and Reduce Item Prices

   Users can increase or decrease the prices of predefined items. The app will automatically update the price allocations and remaining budget after such changes.

5. Modify Price Allocations

   If users wish to modify price allocations between items, they can easily do so. The app will recalculate the remaining budget accordingly.

6. Change Currency

   Users have the flexibility to change the currency used in their budget. This allows users from various regions or countries to utilize their preferred currency.
